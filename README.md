# QQ_2D_Navier_Stokes_Conjecture_Simulator

This simulator provides a **conceptual visualization** of **2D incompressible fluid dynamics**. It numerically solves a simplified version of the Navier-Stokes equations, which are fundamental to describing how fluids like air and water move in a 2D plane. The goal is to help you build an intuition for complex fluid phenomena like turbulence, vortex dynamics, and energy dissipation.

CRITICAL NOTE FOR RESEARCHERS: This tool is for educational and conceptual purposes only. It uses a simplified numerical scheme and is **NOT** a high-fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) tool. It **cannot be used to formally prove or disprove mathematical conjectures** about the Navier-Stokes equations. That is a question of pure mathematics concerning the properties of the continuous equations, not numerical approximations.

BETA SOFTWARE NOTICE: This application is under active development. While we strive for numerical accuracy for the implemented PDE, bugs or unexpected behaviors may be present. Your use of this tool acknowledges its experimental status.
